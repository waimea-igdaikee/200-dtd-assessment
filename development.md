## Design, Development and Testing Log

### 2024-05-16

I have created an initial database relation diagram. I will check with my Mum to see what is needed.

Feedback from my Mum:
> There is no need to store a list of people; having a person's name and email address in the booking form is enough. Wouldn't that also mean people would have to make a profile first in order to book something? I don't want that.

### 2024-05-21

I have created a flow diagram showing how users would interact with the website:

I have also created a new database relation diagram based on my Mum's feedback - she said she doesn't want any sort of account system. As such the updated diagram is below:

Feedback from my Mum on the new database relation diagram
> This new database layout makes more sense.

As such I have made this database in Adminer:

### 2024-05-23

I am working on a black and white website mock-up on Figma that to show to my Mum.

So far I have made a very rough mock-up of the public half of the website.

Once I get the admin side of the website set up I will show my Mum what she thinks.

### 2024-05-27

I am working on the admin console for the Figma mock-up.

I have completed the interactive figma mock-up:

I will get my Mum to interactively test it out and get feedback from her.

> The general layout was quite intuitive. From this mock website I only have minor critiques:
>- The 'create booking' text should be a button instead of a text link.
>- When creating a booking, an Email should be required but a phone number optional.
>- If the user selects 'No' to the 'Online' section, there needs to be a text box for where they want to meet.

### 2024-05-30

I have made the appropriate changes to cater to my Mum's above requests.

I sat down with my Mum on Realtime Colours and she decided on the following colour palette and fonts, though she said she will have to see it on the actual website mockup and go from there.

### 2024-06-10

I have put the above colours and fonts into the figma website mockup. I will get feedback.

Feedback from my Mum:
> - The fonts seem right; they are easy to read. 
> - The yellow is the wrong shade. It needs to be stronger. 
> - I'd like a flower next to my name at the top.
> - I'd like to see what it looks like if all the yellow sections had black outlines.
> - On second thought I don't want a location input box when people go to create a booking.

### 2024-06-11

I will act on my Mum's feedback, making a separate version for the experimental black outlined version.

It will be important to refer back to the legality implication when choosing my flower photo to ensure I stick within any licenses. For experimental testing purposes, though, I have chosen a free image whose license states that I must attribute the website it came from, www.freepik.com. I will use this image for testing, ensuring I provide attribution, but for the finished product I may design my own image or find another with a royalty free licence.
