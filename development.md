## Design, Development and Testing Log

### 2024-05-16

I have created an initial database relation diagram. I will check with my Mum to see what is needed.

Feedback from my Mum:
> There is no need to store a list of people; having a person's name and email address in the booking form is enough. Wouldn't that also mean people would have to make a profile first in order to book something? I don't want that.

### 2024-05-21

I have created a flow diagram showing how users would interact with the website:

I have also created a new database relation diagram based on my Mum's feedback - she said she doesn't want any sort of account system. As such the updated diagram is below:

Feedback from my Mum on the new database relation diagram
> This new database layout makes more sense.

As such I have made this database in Adminer:

### 2024-05-23

I am working on a black and white website mock-up on Figma that to show to my Mum.

So far I have made a very rough mock-up of the public half of the website.

Once I get the admin side of the website set up I will show my Mum what she thinks.

### 2024-05-27

I am working on the admin console for the Figma mock-up.

I have completed the interactive figma mock-up:

I get my Mum to interactively test it out and get feedback from her.
